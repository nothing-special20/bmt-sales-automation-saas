# Automated Follow-ups for Landscaping Businesses

Automate Sales Tasks

## Installation - Docker

The easiest way to get up and running is with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

Just [install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
and then run:

```
make init
```

This will spin up a database, web worker, celery worker, and Redis broker and run your migrations.

You can then go to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/) to view the app.

### Using the Makefile

You can run `make` to see other helper functions, and you can view the source
of the file in case you need to run any specific commands.

For example, you can run management commands in containers using the same method 
used in the `Makefile`. E.g.

```
docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## Installation - Native

You can also install/run the app directly on your OS using the instructions below.

Setup a virtualenv and install requirements
(this example uses [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)):

```bash
mkvirtualenv bmt_sales_automation -p python3
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Set up database

Create a database named `bmt_sales_automation`.

```
createdb bmt_sales_automation
```

Create database tables:

```
./manage.py migrate
```

## Running server

```bash
./manage.py runserver
```

## Building front-end

To build JavaScript and CSS files, first install npm packages:

```bash
npm install
```

Then to build (and watch for changes locally) just run:

```bash
npm run dev-watch
```

## Running Celery

Celery can be used to run background tasks. To run it you can use:

```bash
celery -A bmt_sales_automation worker -l INFO
```

## Google Authentication Setup

To setup Google Authentication, follow the [instructions here](https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/providers.html#google).


## Running Tests

To run tests simply run:

```bash
./manage.py test
```

Or to test a specific app/module:

```bash
./manage.py test apps.utils.tests.test_slugs
```


On Linux-based systems you can watch for changes using the following:

```bash
find . -name '*.py' | entr python ./manage.py test
```
